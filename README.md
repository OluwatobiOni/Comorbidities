# Comorbidities

Project Overview
This project explores the increasing prevalence of comorbidities—patients with more than one chronic or long-term condition—within the context of an ageing population. As healthcare systems shift focus towards managing the complex needs of individuals with multiple conditions, understanding the trends, causes, and effects of comorbidities is essential for effective healthcare planning and resource allocation.

Using the CDC National Survey Data 2022, this project provides a data-driven analysis of the most common comorbidities affecting populations, and discusses how these complexities are managed in healthcare and data science using measures like the Charlson Comorbidity Index.

Objectives
- Highlight common comorbidities affecting the ageing population, focusing on diseases that frequently co-occur.
- Analyze trends based on the CDC National Survey Data 2022, including age, gender, and geographical factors.
- Explain the complexity of managing comorbidities, using measures such as the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) to quantify risk and guide clinical decision-making.
- Discuss the implications of comorbidities on healthcare systems, patient outcomes, and future research.

Key Findings
- Most common comorbidities: Conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and chronic respiratory illnesses frequently co-occur, particularly in older adults.
- Demographic trends: Comorbidities are more prevalent among certain demographic groups, including older individuals, low-income populations, and those with limited access to healthcare.
- Health outcomes: The presence of multiple chronic conditions complicates treatment and leads to worse outcomes for patients, increasing healthcare costs and strain on resources.

Methods
- Data Source: CDC National Survey Data 2022, a nationally representative survey focused on chronic health conditions in the U.S. population.
- Missing data handled through complete case analysis.
- Categorical variables such as age groups and gender were used to analyze trends.
- Prevalence of individual diseases and co-occurrence patterns were analyzed.
- The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was applied to measure the burden of comorbidity and assess the risk of mortality and hospitalizations.

Visualizations of comorbidity trends across different demographics were created to highlight key insights.
Understanding comorbidities is critical in healthcare data science, as it helps to:
- Predict health outcomes more accurately.
- Guide personalized treatment plans based on the risk profile of patients with multiple conditions.
- Assess the cost-effectiveness of interventions.
- Identify healthcare disparities that can inform public health initiatives

The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) is widely used to quantify the impact of comorbidities. It assigns a score based on the number and severity of chronic conditions a patient has, helping to predict the risk of mortality and guiding clinical decisions.

Future research
Investigating the causal links between chronic conditions and the role of social determinants of health.
